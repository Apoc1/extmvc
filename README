EXT MVC aims to be a complete MVC stack on top of Ext JS (http://extjs.com)

It is being used in several production applications but is still relatively immature so the API *will break* every so often until it's been beaten into a pleasing shape!  Version 0.4 release should be stable, consistent and documented enough for general use.

The most up to date version is currently on the v0.4 branch

Also see http://github.com/edspencer/ext-mvc-rails/tree/master for a related Rails plugin.  This is mostly a bunch of handy generators which need some cleaning up.  http://midlandsweb.lighthouseapp.com/projects/13746-ext-mvc-rails/overview is the Lighthouse URL for ext-mvc-rails.
