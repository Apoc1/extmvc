# This doesn't do anything currently, but should refactor the Plugin builder into builder.rb, then
# use the include_order.txt reading code to build MVC itself instead of updating builder.rb all the time
# Might look something like this:

MVC.js
App.js
lib/*.js
overrides/*.js
controller/*.js
model/**/*/js
view/**/*.js
